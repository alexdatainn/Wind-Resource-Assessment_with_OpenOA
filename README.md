**Assess the performance of operating wind plants**

To quantify and reduce the difference between the expected and the actual energy production of wind plants.

Given the narrow operating margins of wind power plants, the overprediction of energy production—and therefore the overprediction of revenue—is damaging to project economics.

**Definitions**

• EYA AEP: The yearly energy yield according to the Preconstruction Wind Resource Assessments

• Ideal Energy: The energy output of all turbines on the site, under normal conditions. The ideal energy is not subject to downtime or significant underperformance, but is subject to wake losses and moderate turbine performance losses

• Unexplained/Uncertain: These are losses that could not be accounted for by availability or electrical loss. This could typically be explained by factors such as turbine icing or wildlife protection programs.

• OA AEP: This is the yearly energy yield according to the Open OA analysis

**Background**

• Additional information on the OpenOA tool can be found: <https://www.nrel.gov/wind/openoa.html>

o “To share resources and increase consistency across the industry, the OpenOA software was developed to act as an open-source library for assessing operational wind plant performance by providing reference implementations of important operational data structures and analytics methods.”

o “OpenOA grew out of feedback from wind plant owners and consultants gathered through the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Wind Plant Performance Prediction Benchmark initiative”

o Results of the benchmark initiative are saved: APM Team\\General\\Reference documents\\OpenOA
